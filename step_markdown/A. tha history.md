# Short history of *Arabidopsis thaliana*

Columbia is the ecotype that is being sequenced in the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative. There are several Columbia accessions, 0 through 7, all genetically very similar. In many cases, when we have not been able to unambiguously allocate a parental accession to the progenitor for a population, we allocate a new stock name in the form Col-n. (from <https://arabidopsis.info/CollectionInfo?id=94>)

| Col-0 | Direct descendant of Col-1 donated via AIS | N1092 - bulk line |
| Col-0 | Direct descendant of Col-1 donated via AIS | N1093 - single seed line (NASC) |
| Col-0 | Direct descendant of Col-1 donated via AIS | N6673 - single seed line (ABRC) |

Above is the information about all Col-0 seeds.

N1092/N1093 was donated at 1993-06-01. So there is about 30 years history of *A. tha*

According to the article published <https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14649> online, 26 homozygotes of *Arabidopsis* genome (both Col and Ler) were sequenced and total 23 base mutations were found and validated by Sanger sequence. It means approximately 1 SNP per generation per genome.
